# FIT1045-Assignment1

Adventure Land is a game of chance where players have to make their way to the finish line while dealing with the consequences of every dice roll. Players will take turns rolling dice and tallying the results, until one player reaches a score of 50. 

On their journey to reach a score of 50, players will face randomised obstacles depending on their score at a certain time period. 

Rules specific to this assignment are:

- Players begin with a score of 0.
- Players will receive a random variation of dice (i.e. D4, D8, D12, or D20) at each turn.
- Each player will take turns to do one dice roll until one player reaches a score of 50. 
- Player can only win by rolling the exact number needed to reach 50. 
  If a player rolls too high and overshoots (i.e. reach a score greater than 50), 
  then the player does not move for that round (i.e. the player's score does not change).
- Players will face a randomised set of positive and negative scenarios.
- Every player will have a probablity of 0.2 to pass any obstacles faced. 

In this assignment you'll be creating a command-line version of the above game.

You'll start off by building out each piece individually and merge your solutions into one Python file that can be executed through Command Prompt or Terminal to play.
